## Issue Approval Process

To ensure that all issues are valid, necessary, and not duplicates, we follow a structured approval process:

1. **Group Meetings**:
   - New issues will be discussed during our weekly group meetings and/or in our communication channels.
   - Team members will provide feedback, suggest modifications, and collectively approve the issues.

2. **Delegated Approval**:
   - All team members are responsible for reviewing and approving new issues.

3. **Comment-Based Approval**:
   - An issue requires at least 2 team members to comment "approved" before work can begin.
   - Team members should review the issue details, check for duplicates, and ensure all necessary information is provided before commenting their approval.

All approved issues will be documented in our project tracker and assigned to team members as appropriate.
