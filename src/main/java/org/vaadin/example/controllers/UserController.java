/*Purpose: Controllers in a Spring Boot application handle HTTP requests 
and map them to the appropriate business logic. They serve as the intermediaries 
between the client and the backend services.

Functionality: They process incoming requests, handle input validation, a
nd return responses. Controllers often interact with services to perform business 
operations and then return the results to the client, typically in the form of JSON or XML. */
